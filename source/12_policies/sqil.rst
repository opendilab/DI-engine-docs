SQIL
^^^^^^^

Overview
---------
Soft Q imitation learning (SQIL) is an off-policy maximum entropy Q learning algorithm together with imitation learning. SQIL was first proposed in `SQIL: Imitation Learning via Reinforcement Learning with Sparse Rewards <https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.11108>`_, which combines soft Q-learning with imitation learning. In the domain of discrete action spaces, soft Q learning proposed in `Reinforcement Learning with Deep Energy-Based Policies <https://arxiv.org/abs/1702.08165>`_ learns stochastic (maximum entropy) policies instead of determistic policies comparing to the deep Q learning algorithm.


Quick Facts
-------------
1. SQIL is a **model-free** and **value-based** RL algorithm.

2. SQIL is SQL incorporated with Imitation learning.

3. SQIL supports both **discrete** and **continuous** action spaces, which is the same as SQL.

4. SQIL is an **off-policy** algorithm.

5. In DI-engine, SQIL uses **eps-greedy** for exploration.

6. The DI-engine implementation of SQIL only supports **discrete** action spaces for now.

7. The advantages of SQIL include: i. More robustness in the face of uncertain dynamics; ii. A natural incorporation with exploration.

8. SQIL can be regarded as **regularized behavior cloning**, which gains advantage over general behavior cloning.

Key Equations or Key Graphs
---------------------------
SQIL is a behavior cloning variant of SQL, so you may refer to `SQL doc <./sql.html>`_ first.

SQIL performs three small but important modifications on SQL:

1. It initially fills the agent’s experience replay buffer with demonstrations, where the rewards are set
   to a constant r = +1.


2. As the agent interacts with the environment and accumulates new experiences, it adds them to the replay buffer, and sets the rewards for these new experiences to a constant r = 0.


3. It balances the number of demonstration experiences and new experiences (50% each) in each sample from the replay buffer.

BC is a simple approach that seeks to imitate the expert’s actions using supervised learning – in particular, greedily maximizing the conditional likelihood of the demonstrated actions given the demonstrated states, without reasoning about the consequences of actions.
Theoretically, It can be shown that SQIL is equivalent to augmenting BC with a regularization term that incorporates information about the state transition dynamics into the imitation policy, and thus enables long-horizon imitation.

Specifically, recalling from `SQL <./sql.html>`_, the soft Q values are a function of the rewards and dynamics, given
by the the soft Bellman equation:

.. image:: images/sqil_soft_q.png

The policy :math:`\pi` forms a Boltzmann distribution over actions:

.. image:: images/sqil_pi.png

Rearrange the above function, we obtain the formula for the reward:

.. image:: images/sqil_implied_reward.png

Therefore, the regular BC can be derived as follows:

.. image:: images/sqil_bc1.png

.. image:: images/sqil_bc2.png

The regularized BC is formulated through the prior work `Boosted and reward regularized classification for apprenticeship learning <http://www.ifaamas.org/Proceedings/aamas2014/aamas/p1249.pdf>`_ where Q is regularized with a sparsity prior on the above rewards.
By adding BC with this regularization, our final regularized BC target incorporates information about the state transition dynamics
into the imitation learning objective, since :math:`R_{q}(s,a)` is a function of an expectation over next state :math:`s'`. Formally, its formula is given as follows:

.. image:: images/sqil_rbc.png

where where :math:`\lambda \in \mathbb{R}_{>0}`  is a constant hyperparameter, and  :math:`\delta` denotes the squared soft Bellman error defined
in the equation in the Pseudo-code part below. The BC loss encourages :math:`Q`  to output high values for demonstrated actions at
demonstrated states, and the penalty term propagates those high values to nearby states. In other
words, :math:`Q`  outputs high values for actions that lead to states from which the demonstrated states are
reachable. Hence, when the agent finds itself far from the demonstrated states, it takes actions that
lead it back to the demonstrated states.

Surprisingly, it can be proved that the gradient of the regularized BC loss in the above equation is proportional to the gradient of the SQIL
loss in line 4 of Algorithm 1 below, plus an additional term that penalizes the soft value of the initial state :math:`s_{0}`

For the full derivation, please refer to Section A.1 of the appendix in the original paper.

In summary, SQIL solves a similar optimization problem to regularized BC proposed in `Boosted and reward regularized classification for apprenticeship learning <http://www.ifaamas.org/Proceedings/aamas2014/aamas/p1249.pdf>`_. However, SQIL can be motivated as a more practical and trivial way to implement the ideas for the regularized BC.
Furthermore, the ablation study from the experiments in the paper suggests that SQIL actually performs better than the regularized BC.

We use an epsilon-greedy strategy when implementing the SQIL/SQL policy.  How we pick actions is implemented in  ``EpsGreedySampleWrapper_sql`` of ``ding/model/wrappers/model_wrappers.py``

.. code-block:: python

      class EpsGreedySampleWrapperSql(IModelWrapper):

         def forward(self, *args, **kwargs):
            eps = kwargs.pop('eps')
            alpha = kwargs.pop('alpha')
            output = self._model.forward(*args, **kwargs)
            assert isinstance(output, dict), "model output must be dict, but find {}".format(type(output))
            logit = output['logit']
            assert isinstance(logit, torch.Tensor) or isinstance(logit, list)
            if isinstance(logit, torch.Tensor):
                  logit = [logit]
            if 'action_mask' in output:
                  mask = output['action_mask']
                  if isinstance(mask, torch.Tensor):
                     mask = [mask]
                  logit = [l.sub_(1e8 * (1 - m)) for l, m in zip(logit, mask)]
            else:
                  mask = None
            action = []
            for i, l in enumerate(logit):
                  if np.random.random() > eps:
                     prob = torch.softmax(output['logit'] / alpha, dim=-1)
                     prob = prob / torch.sum(prob, 1, keepdims=True)
                     pi_action = torch.zeros(prob.shape)
                     pi_action = Categorical(prob)
                     pi_action = pi_action.sample()
                     action.append(pi_action)
                  else:
                     if mask:
                        action.append(sample_action(prob=mask[i].float()))
                     else:
                        action.append(torch.randint(0, l.shape[-1], size=l.shape[:-1]))
            if len(action) == 1:
                  action, logit = action[0], logit[0]
            output['action'] = action
            return output


We have two buffers: one buffer is for new data which is collected through interacting with the environment and the other one is for demonstration data. We obtain the demonstration data online. That is,
we use a well-trained model to generate data in the collecting stage and push them into the demonstration buffer. In learning process, we sample from these two buffers separately shown as follows:

.. code-block:: python

      # During the learning stage
      for i in range(cfg.policy.learn.update_per_collect):
         train_data_new = replay_buffer_new.sample(
               (learner.policy.get_attribute('batch_size') // 2), learner.train_iter
         )
         train_data_demonstration = replay_buffer_demonstration.sample(
               (learner.policy.get_attribute('batch_size') // 2), learner.train_iter
         )
         if train_data_new is None and train_data_demonstration is None:
               train_data = None
         else:
               train_data = train_data_new + train_data_demonstration
         if train_data is not None:
               learner.train(train_data, collector.envstep)

We also need to modify rewards for new data and demonstration data. Taking the CartPole environment as an example:

.. code-block:: python

        new_data = collector.collect_data(learner.train_iter, policy_kwargs={'eps': eps})
        for i in range(len(new_data)):
            device = new_data[i]['obs'].device
            new_data[i].reward = torch.tensor([0.]).to(device)

Regarding the demonstration data, we can leave these rewards unchanged. For a general reward modification, please refer to ``ding//entry/serial_entry_sqil.py``.
