------


Q1: Import packages warning
--------------------------------------

**A1:**

Regarding import linlink, ceph, memcache, redis related warnings displayed on the command line when running DI-engine, generally users can ignore it, and DI-engine will automatically search for corresponding alternative libraries or code implementations during import.

Q2: Cannot use DI-engine command line tool (CLI) after installation
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**A2:**

- pip with ``-e`` flag might sometimes make CLI not available. Generally, non-developers do not need to install with ``-e`` flag, removing the flag and reinstall is sufficient.
- Part of the operating environment will install the CLI in the user directory, you need to verify whether the CLI installation directory is in the user's environment variable (such as ``$PATH`` in Linux).


Q3: "No permission" error occurred during installation
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**A3:**

Due to the lack of corresponding permissions in some operating environments, "Permission denied" may appear during pip installation. The specific reasons and solutions are as follows:
 - pip with ``--user`` flag and install in user's directory
 - Move the ``.git`` folder in the root directory out, execute the pip installation command, and then move it back. For specific reasons, see `<https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/4525>`_


Q4: How to set the relevant operating parameters of ``SyncSubprocessEnvManager``
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**A4:**

Add ``manager`` field to the ``env`` field in cfg file, you can specify whether to use ``shared_memory`` as well as the context of multiprocessing launch. The following code provides a simple example. For detailed parameter information, please refer to ``SyncSubprocessEnvManager``.

.. code::

    config = dict(
        env=dict(
            manager=dict(shared_memory=False)
        )
    )

Q5: How to adjust the learning rate
--------------------------------------------------

:A5:

Add ``lr_scheduler`` module in the entry file. 
You can adjust the learning rate by calling ``torch.optim.lr_scheduler`` (refer to `<https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/optim.html>`_) and apply the ``scheduler.step()`` to update the learning rate after optimizerâ€™s update.
The following code provides a simple example. For more detail, see demo: `<https://github.com/opendilab/DI-engine/commit/9cad6575e5c00036aba6419f95cdce0e7342630f>`_.

.. code::

    from torch.optim.lr_scheduler import LambdaLR

    ...

    # Set up RL Policy
    policy = DDPGPolicy(cfg.policy, model=model)
    # Set up lr_scheduler, the optimizer attribute will be different in different policy.
    # For example, in DDPGPolicy the attribute is 'optimizer_actor', but in DQNPolicy the attribute is 'optimizer'.
    lr_scheduler = LambdaLR(
        policy.learn_mode.get_attribute('optimizer_actor'), lr_lambda=lambda iters: min(1.0, 0.5 + 0.5 * iters / 1000)
    )

    ...

    # Train
        for i in range(cfg.policy.learn.update_per_collect):
            ...
            learner.train(train_data, collector.envstep)
            lr_scheduler.step()

The curve of learning rate is shown in the figure below

Q6: How to understand the printed [EVALUATOR] information
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**A6:**

We print out the evaluation information of ``evaluator`` in `interaction_serial_evaluator.py <https://github.com/opendilab/DI-engine/blob/main/ding/worker/collector/interaction_serial_evaluator.py#L253>`_ ,
including ``env``, ``final reward``, ``current episode``, which represent the ``eval_env`` index (``env_id``) corresponding to the current completed episode (in which ``timestep.done=True``),
the final reward of the completed episode, and how many episodes it was evaluated by the ``evaluator``, respectively. A typical demonstration log is shown in the figure below:

.. image:: images/Q6_evaluator_info.png
   :align: center
   :height: 250

In some cases, different evaluator environment (abbreviated as ``eval_env``) in the ``evaluator`` may collect episodes with different lengths. For example, suppose we collect 16 episodes through ``evaluator``, but only have 5 ``eval_env``,
i.e. setting ``n_evaluator_episode=16, evaluator_env_num=5`` in config,
If we do not limit the number of evaluation episodes in each ``eval_env``, it is likely that we will get many episodes with short lengths.
As a result, the average reward obtained in this evaluation phase will be biased and cannot fully reflect the performance of the current policy (Only reflects the performance on episodes with shorter lengths).

To address this issue, we propose to utilize the `VectorEvalMonitor <https://github.com/opendilab/DI-engine/blob/main/ding/worker/collector/base_serial_evaluator.py#L78>`_ class.
In this class, we averagely specify the number of episodes each ``eval_env`` needs to evaluate in `here <https://github.com/opendilab/DI-engine/blob/main/ding/worker/collector/base_serial_evaluator.py#L103>`_,
e.g. if ``n_evaluator_episode=16`` and ``evaluator_env_num=8``, then only 2 episodes of each ``eval_env`` will be added into statistics.
For the specific meaning of each method of ``VectorEvalMonitor``, please refer to the annotations in class `VectorEvalMonitor <https://github.com/opendilab/DI-engine/blob/main/ding/worker/collector/base_serial_evaluator.py#L78>`_.

..
    and we use `dict <https://github.com/opendilab/DI-engine/blob/main/ding/worker/collector/base_serial_evaluator.py#L110>`_ to store the rewards of the episodes evaluated on each ``eval_env``.
    Note that, for each ``eval_env``, we specify a ``deque`` with ``max_length`` equal to ``the number of episodes each eval_env needs to evaluate`` (``each_env_episode[i]`` in code) to store the episode rewards.


It is worth noting that when a certain  ``eval_env`` of the ``evaluator`` completes the number of ``each_env_episode[i]`` episodes, since the reset of the ``eval_env`` is controlled by
`env_manager <https://github.com/opendilab/DI-engine/blob/main/ding/envs/env_manager/subprocess_env_manager.py>`_ automatically, the certain ``eval_env`` will continue to run until exiting the whole evaluation phase.
We utilize ``VectorEvalMonitor`` to control the termination/exiting of the evaluation phase, only if
`eval_monitor.is_finished() <https://github.com/opendilab/DI-engine/blob/main/ding/worker/collector/interaction_serial_evaluator.py#L224>`_ is True
, i.e. the evaluator completes all evaluation episodes (``n_evaluator_episode`` in config), the ``evaluator`` will exit the evaluation phase.
Thus there may be a case where the corresponding log information of an ``eval_env`` is still repeated even if it finishes the evaluation of ``each_env_episode[i]`` episodes, which
do not adversely affect the evaluation results, so the users don't need to be worried about these repeated logs.

Q7: Is there any documentation for the config file in DI-engine? How can I set the fields in the config file to control training termination?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**A7:**

For a detailed introduction to the `configuration file system in DI-engine, please refer to the Configuration File System Documentation <https://di-engine-docs.readthedocs.io/zh_CN/latest/03_system/config_zh.html>`_. In DI-engine, there are generally three types of termination settings:

- When the pre-set ``stop value`` (modified in the config file) is reached, i.e., when the ``evaluation episode reward mean`` is greater than or equal to the ``stop value``.

- When the maximum number of environment interaction steps (``env step``) is reached, which can be modified in the training entry.

  - Example 1: https://github.com/opendilab/DI-engine/blob/main/ding/entry/serial_entry.py#L24

  - Example 2: https://github.com/opendilab/DI-engine/blob/main/ding/example/sac.py#L41 (setting the value of ``max_env_step``)

- When the maximum number of training iterations (``train iter``) is reached, which can be modified in the training entry.

  - Example 1: https://github.com/opendilab/DI-engine/blob/main/ding/entry/serial_entry.py#L23

  - Example 2: https://github.com/opendilab/DI-engine/blob/main/ding/example/sac.py#L41

Furthermore, for specific field descriptions in the config file, you can refer to the comments in the default config section of each class. For example:

- `DQN default config <https://github.com/opendilab/DI-engine/blob/main/ding/policy/dqn.py#L85>`_

- `SAC default config <https://github.com/opendilab/DI-engine/blob/main/ding/policy/sac.py#L64>`_

Reinforcement learning-related configuration files can be complex. If there are any details you don't understand, please feel free to ask!

Q8: DI-engine installation-related questions.
----------------------------------------------------

- **Q8-1** Can DI-engine be installed using pip?

  **A8-1:**

  Yes, you can directly use the command ``pip install DI-engine`` for installation. For more details, please refer to the Installation Guide - `Installing Released Versions <https://di-engine-docs.readthedocs.io/zh_CN/latest/01_quickstart/installation_zh.html#id3>`_.

- **Q8-2** Does the installation of DI-engine automatically install PyTorch? What happens if PyTorch is already installed on the computer?

  **A8-2:** 

  If PyTorch has been installed in the current environment and its version meets the requirements during the DI-engine installation, DI-engine will directly install other required packages. If PyTorch has not been installed previously, DI-engine will install the CPU version of PyTorch by default. It is recommended to install the appropriate version of PyTorch beforehand. Otherwise, DI-engine will install the CPU version of PyTorch by default. For specific installation steps, please refer to the `Installation Guide <https://di-engine-docs.readthedocs.io/zh_CN/latest/index_zh.html>`_.

- **Q8-3** Which version of gym does DI-engine correspond to? Does it not support the latest gym version?

  **A8-3:** 

  Currently, DI-engine corresponds to gym version 0.25.1 (2023.5.5). For the compatibility of various dependencies with DI-engine, you can refer to the `setup.py <https://github.com/opendilab/DI-engine/blob/main/setup.py#L53>`_ file.

- **Q8-4** 

  **A8-4:** 

  You can clone the repository from GitHub and navigate to the respective folder. Then run ``pip install -e .`` as follows:

  .. code-block::

    git clone https://github.com/opendilab/DI-engine.git
    cd DI-engine
    pip install .


Q9: What does "episode" refer to in DI-engine?
----------------------------------------------------

**A9:**

It is not an original concept in reinforcement learning but originates from gaming. It is similar to the concept of a "level" and refers to the process where an agent starts playing a game until it reaches a game over or successfully completes the game. In essence, it represents a complete cycle of interaction with the environment, such as a game session or a game of Go. 


Q10: Does DI-engine support the self-play mechanism?
----------------------------------------------------

**A10:**

Yes, it is supported. The simplest examples can be found in the `league demo <https://github.com/opendilab/DI-engine/tree/main/dizoo/league_demo>`_ and `slime volleyball <https://github.com/opendilab/DI-engine/tree/main/dizoo/slime_volley>`_ in the ``dizoo`` directory.
