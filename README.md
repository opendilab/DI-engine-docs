This is an educational resource produced by OpenDILab that makes it easier to learn about Decision Intelligence and DI-engine

For the unfamiliar: [Decision Intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_intelligence#Relationship_to_artificial_intelligence_and_machine_learning) application provides a framework for best practices in organizational decision-making and processes for applying machine learning at scale.

This module contains a variety of helpful resources, including:

- a short [introduction](https://di-engine-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/00_intro/index.html) about DI-engine
- an [essay](https://di-engine-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/10_concepts/basic_rl.html) about  important Concepts of reinforcement learning
- a [curated list](https://di-engine-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/12_policies/index.html) of reinforcement algorithms cheat sheet organized by learning methods
- an [environment example](https://di-engine-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/13_envs/index.html) often used by reinforcement algorithm
- and some [API descriptions](https://di-engine-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/05_api_doc/index.html) to serve as warm-ups.
