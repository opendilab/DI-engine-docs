This is an educational resource produced by OpenDILab that makes it easier to learn about Decision Intelligence and DI-engine.

For the unfamiliar: [Decision Intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_intelligence#Relationship_to_artificial_intelligence_and_machine_learning) is an engineering discipline that augments data science with theory from social science, decision theory, and managerial science.

This documentation contains a variety of helpful resources, including:

- an [introduction](https://di-engine-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/00_intro/index.html) about DI-engine | [DI-engine 介绍](https://di-engine-docs.readthedocs.io/zh_CN/latest/00_intro/index_zh.html)
